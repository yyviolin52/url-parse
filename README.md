# url-parse
In 2016, I created automation leveraging Python to scrap H1 Tag, metadata, and tracking code on over 100 websites and sent daily email alerts if data changed.

The purpose of the project is to save my SEO buddies tons of time. Instead of checking over 200 clients' websites on a daily basis, a simple python code does that job to check whether our work has been implemented successfully.

In reality, the clients have different website structures, so when parsing the H1 tag, meta information will be a little bit different.

To perform this code, you will need a text file in your local computer/cloud contains website URLs.

Feel free to rewrite the code.
